# Hi, I'm Silvia ğŸ‘‹

I started my career as a **designer and developer** focussing on *usability, accessibility and information architecture*. For nine years, I lived in the UK, where I co-founded the web agency UI Farm and worked for clients spanning several industries, such as **banking, retail and energy**.

My mission is to create meaningful interactions that serve people and businesses best, through considerate, research-based design. I offer **UX consultancy** (problem-finding, research-based prototypes), **design and development** of apps and websites.

ğŸ˜„ **Pronouns**: she/her

ğŸ”­ **Iâ€™m currently working on**: a HowTo website with tips and snippets to help designers interested in coding.
