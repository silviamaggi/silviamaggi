## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I started my career as web designer and developer, wanting to build intuitive, usable and accessible interfaces.
Gradually, I focused on user experience, bringing my attention from **how** things work to **why**.

My mission is to help creating interactions that serve people best, through careful research and design.
